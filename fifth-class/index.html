        <p>Donald Trump is an American businessman and political figure best known for his work in real estate, branding, and television before entering politics. He built a global business empire centered on real estate development, hotels, and licensing his name, and later gained widespread public recognition as the host of the TV show The Apprentice. His bold communication style and focus on deal-making made him a highly visible and controversial public figure long before his political career.</p>
